# STL Files

This folder contains processed STL files of a human heart from the workshop. The files are provided at different steps of processing, from raw segmentations to fully smoothed meshes:
- file1: a raw segmentation of the heart after processing DICOM files in 3D Slicer
- file2: a cleaned 3D model of the heart after cleaning and repairing steps in MeshLab
- file3: a smoothed 3D model of the heart after making into a solid and brush editing in MeshMixer
- file4: a simplified 3D model of the heart after further remeshing in MeshLab, suitable for 3D printing
